# Titanic
This is my first attempt at machine learning, beginning with the all basic Titanic dataset!

Do have a look at the notebook for my code although *spoiler alert!* it's really nothing outstanding.

I've submitted it on Kaggle with a score of 0.74, (no where near a decent ranking, obviously)

Top 3 Valuable lessons:

Practice in building a simple machine learning model
Data pre-processing is important and will help your model.
Data cleaning processing skills are essential and mine isn't up to par yet (Pandas)

Top 3 things I would like to accomplish in the future:

Using Gridsearch to optimise the model
Improving skills in data wrangling
Using ensembles to stack different models
